System Setup (Linux)
`For this tutorial, we will be using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. First, java is required to run bungee cord and the server file. To do this, we will need to run the following commands:`

`sudo apt install default-jdk && sudo apt install default-jre -y
`
<br>
<br>
(" Warning Linux Is Untested Only Codespaces have been tested ")
<br>
<br>
`Installing The Server
Now, we need to clone the server repo using git. Please run the following command:`

`git clone alexleo2/test-network
`

OR Host On Github
`fork this `

` Make A codespace `
<br>
<br>
`https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#:~:text=On%20GitHub.com%2C%20navigate%20to,then%20click%20the%20Codespaces%20tab.`

`Now, open 4 terminal tabs in the new server directory and paste in the following snippets:`

`first tab: cd server && sudo java -jar server.jar`

`second tab: cd server2 && sudo java -jar server.jar`

`third tab: cd server3 && sudo java -jar server.jar`

`forth tab: cd bungee && sudo java -jar bungee.jar`


`Making Server Public
Great! Now, you need to forward ports 8081 25565 and 8082 and 8083
Installing Plugins
To install plugins, navigate to server > plugins. You will need to clone the initial [plugin-name.jar] file as well as create a separate directory in the plugins folder to store the additional data. Then restart the server and the plugin should be running! PLUGINS DO NOT TRANSFER BETWEEN BOTH SERVERS YOU WILL NET TO CONFIG FOR BOTH TO ADD PLUGINS TO THE OTHER SERVER GO TO [server2 > plugins] TO ADD PLUGINS TOT THAT ONE TWO  AND FOR SERVER3
ADD PLUGINS AT [server3 > plugins] `
<br>
<br>

` also you can change the name of the 2an server in [bungee > config.yml] Just the display name of it though`
  <br> 
  <br> `IDEAS
make plugins not need to be added to every single server ( cuz that's annoying) but make it work by just adding it to one 
This will take a while to complete but I also even plan to add 2 more servers to it To Make IT A Better Network `
<br>
<br>

`You can also host on https://gitpod.io/new#https://github.com/alexleo2/test-network Untested though`
